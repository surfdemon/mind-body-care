## Design Decisions 

### Wireframes 
  Wirfeframes have been created with the Balsamiq Wireframes program.

  [Wireframes PDF](./assets/images/Mind-Body-Care-Wireframes.pdf)

  I have tried to design the website so that it looks clean and modern.



  #### Colours
  For the colours I've tried to pick ones that will suit the look and feel of the site and make it easy on the eye. I also went with blueish colours as I find blue to be a calming colour. 

  * Light Background = #F5F5F5
  * Dark Background = #424242
  * Mid Colour = #229799
  * Light Text = #48CFCB
  * Dark Text = #242424

  These have been tested using the [Adobe Color Accessibility](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility) tool and there are no conflicts.

  ------ NOTE! ---- 
  Check the colors with the WCAG Contrast Checker as well!

  #### Font 
  I have picked two fonts from Google fonts. 

  [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)
  [Noto Serif Georgian](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+Georgian?preview.text=Mind%20%26%20Body%20Care&query=georgia)
  Both with Serif as the backup.
